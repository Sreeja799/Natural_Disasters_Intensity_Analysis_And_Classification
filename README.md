# Natural Disasters Intensity Analysis And Classification
This project uses Multilayered deep CNN model that classifies the natural disaster and tells the intensity of disaster. The model uses an integrated webcam to capture the video frame and is compared with the Pre-trained model and the type of disaster is identified and showcased on the OpenCV window

## Project Flow
-> The user interacts with the UI (User Interface) to open the integrated webcam.

-> The video frames are captured and analyzed by the model which is integrated with flask application.

-> Once model analyses the video frames, the prediction is showcased on the UI and OpenCV window
